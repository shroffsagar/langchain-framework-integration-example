    "### Purpose of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates use of various tools and libraries to interact with OpenAI's language models and LangChain. The key objectives include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting up OpenAI API**: Installing necessary packages, retrieving API keys, and initializing the OpenAI client.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interaction with LLM**: Defining functions to interact with the language model for generating responses based on user prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Translating text styles**: Using the language model to translate text into different styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **LangChain Integration**: Installing and using LangChain to create structured prompts and parse responses from the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output Parsing**: Defining response schemas and using LangChain formatters to automatically generate and parse structured outputs from the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Extracting insights using ReACT technique**: Formatting prompts to extract insights from text by leveraging chain of thought reasoning (ReACT). This involves guiding the model through a logical sequence of intermediate steps to ensure accurate extraction and parsing of the model's responses into structured data.\n",
