      "Automation: {'input': 'Automated the tests provided in this test plan:\\n### Test Plan for Advanced Row Filtering in ETL Tool\\n\\n#### 1. **Test Plan Overview**\\nThis test plan outlines the strategy and approach for testing the advanced filtering feature in the ETL tool. The goal is to ensure that the filtering functionality meets the acceptance criteria and addresses the user needs effectively while identifying potential edge cases and gaps.\\n\\n#### 2. **Objectives**\\n- Validate the functionality of advanced filter expressions.\\n- Ensure the user interface is intuitive and meets user expectations.\\n- Assess performance under various data loads.\\n- Identify and handle error scenarios gracefully.\\n- Confirm that saved filter expressions can be reused effectively.\\n\\n#### 3. **Scope of Testing**\\n- **In-Scope**:\\n  - Functionality of filter expressions (simple and complex).\\n  - Logical and comparison operators.\\n  - User interface for filter definition.\\n  - Error handling for invalid expressions.\\n  - Performance testing with large datasets.\\n  - Saving and reusing filter expressions.\\n\\n- **Out-of-Scope**:\\n  - Integration with external systems (unless directly related to filtering).\\n  - Non-filtering related features of the ETL tool.\\n\\n#### 4. **Test Strategy**\\n- **Types of Testing**:\\n  - **Functional Testing**: Validate that the filtering works as expected based on the acceptance criteria.\\n  - **Usability Testing**: Ensure the user interface is user-friendly and intuitive.\\n  - **Performance Testing**: Measure the time taken to filter large datasets.\\n  - **Error Handling Testing**: Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid filter expressions.\\n  - **Regression Testing**: Ensure that existing functionalities are not broken by the new feature.\\n\\n#### 5. **Test Environment**\\n- ETL tool deployed in a staging environment with access to various data sources.\\n- Test data sets of varying sizes (small, medium, large, and very large datasets).\\n\\n#### 6. **Test Cases**\\nBased on the acceptance criteria and additional considerations, the following test cases will be executed:\\n\\n1. **Basic Functionality Tests**:\\n   - Apply simple filter expressions (e.g., \"age > 30\").\\n   - Apply complex filter expressions (e.g., \"age > 30 AND country = \\'USA\\'\").\\n   - Use logical operators in filter expressions (e.g., \"age < 20 OR (country = \\'Canada\\' AND status = \\'active\\')\").\\n\\n2. **Error Handling Tests**:\\n   - Define an invalid filter expression (e.g., \"age >\") and verify error message.\\n   - Define a filter expression with unsupported operators and verify error message.\\n\\n3. **Usability Tests**:\\n   - Navigate to the filter definition section and verify the presence of a visual editor.\\n   - Test the ease of creating and editing filter expressions using the UI.\\n\\n4. **Performance Tests**:\\n   - Apply filter expressions on datasets of varying sizes (1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000 rows) and measure response time.\\n   - Test performance with concurrent users applying filters simultaneously.\\n\\n5. **Save and Reuse Tests**:\\n   - Save a filter expression and verify it is available for future use.\\n   - Edit a saved filter expression and verify changes are reflected.\\n\\n6. **Edge Case Tests**:\\n   - Test with boundary values (e.g., age = 30).\\n   - Test with special characters in filter expressions (e.g., \"name = \\'O\\'Reilly\\'\").\\n   - Test with null or empty values in filter expressions.\\n\\n#### 7. **Pending Items / Open Questions**\\n- Clarification on the types of data sources supported for filtering.\\n- Confirmation on the specific advanced filter expressions expected.\\n- Definition of limitations on the complexity of filter expressions.\\n- User roles and permissions related to filter access.\\n- Expected performance benchmarks for different data sizes.\\n\\n#### 8. **Risk Assessment**\\n- **High Risk**: Performance issues with large datasets could impact user experience.\\n- **Medium Risk**: Usability issues may lead to user frustration if the interface is not intuitive.\\n- **Low Risk**: Error handling may not cover all edge cases, leading to potential confusion.\\n\\n#### 9. **Test Schedule**\\n- **Test Preparation**: [Insert Dates]\\n- **Test Execution**: [Insert Dates]\\n- **Test Closure**: [Insert Dates]\\n\\n#### 10. **Reporting**\\n- Test results will be documented and reported to stakeholders.\\n- Any defects identified will be logged in the defect tracking system.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThis test plan provides a comprehensive approach to validating the advanced filtering feature in the ETL tool. By addressing both the acceptance criteria and additional considerations, we aim to ensure a robust and user-friendly implementation that meets the needs of the users effectively. Regular communication with stakeholders will be essential to address any pending items and clarify open questions.'}\n",

      "- **E2E Tests**: Cover critical user interactions and usability aspects using Playwright. These tests ensure that the user interface behaves as expected and that the application can handle user inputs correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Best Practices Followed\n",
      "- **Test Pyramid**: Prioritized API tests to cover business logic and reduced reliance on E2E tests.\n",
      "- **Maintainability**: Organized tests into clear sections and used descriptive names for test cases and keywords.\n",
      "- **Error Handling**: Included tests for invalid inputs to ensure robustness.\n",
      "- **Performance Considerations**: Incorporated performance tests to validate response times under load.\n",
